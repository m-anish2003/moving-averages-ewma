# Moving Averages and EWMA

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that compares **Simple Moving Averages (SMA)** and **Exponentially Weighted Moving Averages (EWMA)** for time series analysis. It provides theoretical explanations and practical implementations using Python.

## Features
- Explanation of SMA and EWMA.
- Implementation using `pandas`.
- Visualizations to compare the two methods.
- Use of the International Airline Passengers dataset.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m-anish2003/moving-averages-ewma.git

### 2. Install Required Python Libraries
Before running the notebook, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can do this by running:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib

jupyter notebook 02_EWMA_Exponentially_Weighted_Moving_Average.ipynb
